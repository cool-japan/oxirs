# OxiRS ARQ - TODO

*Last Updated: October 4, 2025*

## âœ… Current Status: v0.1.0-alpha.2 Production-Ready

**oxirs-arq** provides a SPARQL 1.1/1.2 query engine with optimization.

### Alpha.2 Release Status (October 4, 2025)
- **114 tests** (unit + integration) with zero compilation warnings
- **SPARQL 1.1/1.2 support** with persisted dataset awareness
- **Federation (`SERVICE`)** with retries, failover, and JSON result merging
- **SciRS2 instrumentation** powering query metrics and slow-query tracing
- **CLI Integration** âœ¨ Full parity with `oxirs query` and REPL workflows
- **Production Tested**: SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE across persisted stores

### ðŸŽ‰ Alpha.2 Achievements

#### Federation & Tooling âœ…
- âœ… **Query Command Integration**: Full SPARQL execution via CLI & REPL with streaming output
- âœ… **Federated Execution**: Resilient remote endpoint calls with backoff and `SERVICE SILENT`
- âœ… **Instrumentation**: Exposed metrics and tracing hooks through SciRS2
- âœ… **Production Testing**: Validated with 7 integration tests plus federation smoke tests
