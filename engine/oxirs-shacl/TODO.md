## üéØ Risk Mitigation and Enhanced Contingency Plans

### Enhanced High-Risk Areas
1. **SHACL-SPARQL Security**: Multi-layer sandboxing + formal verification
2. **Performance on Massive Datasets**: Distributed processing + advanced caching
3. **Complex Property Path Evaluation**: Algorithm research + optimization
4. **Memory Usage for Deep Recursion**: Iterative algorithms + memory pooling
5. **Enterprise Security Requirements**: Security audit + penetration testing
6. **Community Adoption**: Developer advocacy + ecosystem partnerships

### Enhanced Contingency Plans
1. **If W3C compliance delayed**: Phased compliance with priority matrix
2. **If performance targets missed**: Parallel processing + GPU acceleration
3. **If integration issues arise**: Adapter layers + compatibility modes
4. **If security concerns raised**: Independent security audit + fixes
5. **If community growth stalls**: Developer advocacy program + partnerships
6. **If enterprise adoption slow**: Commercial support + success stories
