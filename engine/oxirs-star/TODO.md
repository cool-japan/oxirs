- **SPARQL-star Query Engine** - Full SPARQL-star query support with extensions
- **Quoted Triple Store** - Efficient storage and indexing for quoted triples
- **Annotation Support** - Statement-level annotations and metadata
- **Adaptive Query Optimization** - ML, quantum-inspired, classical, and hybrid strategies
- **HDT-star Format** - Binary serialization with dictionary compression
- **Streaming Query Processor** - Continuous queries with window types
- **Property Graph Bridge** - RDF-star to Neo4j/Cypher conversion
- **SHACL-star Validation** - Shape validation for quoted triples
- **GraphQL Integration** - GraphQL API for RDF-star data
- **Reasoning Engine** - RDFS and OWL 2 RL support
- **Cryptographic Provenance** - Secure triple signing and verification
