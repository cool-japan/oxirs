# OxiRS-Star TODO - ‚úÖ 80% COMPLETED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CURRENT STATUS: COMPILATION ERRORS NEED FIXING (July 1, 2025)

**Implementation Status**: ‚ùå **COMPILATION FAILING** - Multiple compilation errors in tests and core modules + Duplicate test modules and missing types  
**Production Readiness**: ‚ùå Not production-ready due to compilation failures + Test infrastructure needs cleanup  
**Performance Achieved**: ‚ùå Cannot measure performance until compilation succeeds
