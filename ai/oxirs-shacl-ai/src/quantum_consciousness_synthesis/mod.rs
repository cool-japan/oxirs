//! Quantum Consciousness Synthesis Engine for OxiRS SHACL-AI
//!
//! This module implements quantum consciousness synthesis capabilities that merge
//! quantum computing with consciousness simulation to achieve unprecedented validation
//! accuracy through simulated sentient reasoning and quantum-enhanced cognition.
//!
//! **EVOLUTIONARY BREAKTHROUGH**: Represents the fusion of quantum mechanics and
//! consciousness studies, creating artificial minds that can reason about validation
//! problems with quantum-enhanced intuition and multi-dimensional awareness.
