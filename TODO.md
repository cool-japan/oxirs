## Timeline Estimate

- **0.1.0-alpha.1**: (Q2 2025)
- **0.1.0**: 
- **1.0.0**: 

This aggressive but achievable timeline gets 80% of functionality into 0.1.0, making OxiRS immediately useful while leaving advanced features for 1.0.0.

## Key Insights from Oxigraph Analysis

### Architecture Lessons
- **Modular design**: Oxigraph's separation of concerns (parsing, storage, evaluation) is excellent
- **Numeric encoding**: Critical for storage efficiency - must understand and port this
- **Storage abstraction**: Clean separation between memory and RocksDB backends
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Extensive use of iterators and zero-copy techniques

### Integration Strategy
- **Gradual migration**: Start with basic functionality, gradually add OxiRS-specific features
- **Compatibility testing**: Continuous testing against Oxigraph to ensure compatibility
- **Performance parity**: Maintain or exceed Oxigraph performance benchmarks
- **API compatibility**: Keep APIs compatible where possible for easy migration

### Beyond Oxigraph
- **GraphQL layer**: Completely new functionality requiring careful design
- **AI integration**: Novel features requiring new architecture patterns
- **Clustering**: Distributed systems expertise required
- **Streaming**: Real-time processing capabilities not in Oxigraph

## Key Insights from Jena Analysis

### Jena's Architectural Advantages
- **Comprehensive CLI toolsuite**: 40+ specialized command-line tools
- **Enterprise-grade security**: Fine-grained permissions and access control
- **Advanced reasoning**: Multiple reasoning engines (RDFS, OWL, rules, RETE)
- **Flexible configuration**: Declarative assembler system
- **Validation diversity**: Both SHACL and ShEx support
- **Change management**: RDF Patch system for versioning
- **OWL ecosystem**: Full ontology management capabilities

### Jena Features Not in Oxigraph
- **Permission system**: Role-based access control
- **RDF Patch/Delta**: Change tracking and streaming
- **ShEx validation**: Alternative to SHACL
- **OWL API compatibility**: Ontology management
- **Advanced reasoning**: RETE, rules, multiple OWL profiles
- **Assembler system**: Declarative configuration
- **Comprehensive CLI**: Specialized tools for every operation
- **Text search**: Lucene integration
- **Benchmarking**: Performance testing framework

### Juniper Features Not in Standard RDF Libraries
- **Type-safe GraphQL**: Rust's type system for GraphQL schema safety
- **Procedural macros**: Automatic GraphQL type derivation
- **Multi-framework support**: Integration with all major Rust web frameworks
- **Advanced subscriptions**: Real-time GraphQL subscriptions with WebSocket support
- **Performance optimization**: Look-ahead optimization, DataLoader patterns
- **Comprehensive validation**: Full GraphQL specification compliance
- **IDE integration**: Built-in GraphiQL and Playground support
- **Async-first design**: Native async/await support throughout

### Integration Strategy
- **Gradual enhancement**: Build on Oxigraph foundation first
- **Jena compatibility**: Maintain configuration file compatibility where possible
- **Juniper integration**: Leverage proven GraphQL implementation patterns
- **Performance focus**: Rust advantages in memory safety and speed
- **Modern additions**: GraphQL, AI, clustering beyond Jena capabilities
- **Enterprise features**: Security, monitoring, management beyond Jena
- **Type safety**: Rust's type system for both RDF and GraphQL safety
- **Framework agnostic**: Support for all major Rust web frameworks

*This TODO list is living documentation and should be updated as the project evolves. Priority should be given to porting and understanding Oxigraph's proven architecture, integrating Juniper's GraphQL capabilities, then adding Jena's enterprise features, before implementing novel OxiRS capabilities.*
