## Timeline Estimate

- **0.1.0-alpha.1**: (Q2 2025)
- **0.1.0**: 
- **1.0.0**: 

This aggressive but achievable timeline gets 80% of functionality into 0.1.0, making OxiRS immediately useful while leaving advanced features for 1.0.0.

## Key Insights from Oxigraph Analysis

### Architecture Lessons
- **Modular design**: Oxigraph's separation of concerns (parsing, storage, evaluation) is excellent
- **Numeric encoding**: Critical for storage efficiency - must understand and port this
- **Storage abstraction**: Clean separation between memory and RocksDB backends
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance**: Extensive use of iterators and zero-copy techniques

### Integration Strategy
- **Gradual migration**: Start with basic functionality, gradually add OxiRS-specific features
- **Compatibility testing**: Continuous testing against Oxigraph to ensure compatibility
- **Performance parity**: Maintain or exceed Oxigraph performance benchmarks
- **API compatibility**: Keep APIs compatible where possible for easy migration

### Beyond Oxigraph
- **GraphQL layer**: Completely new functionality requiring careful design
- **AI integration**: Novel features requiring new architecture patterns
- **Clustering**: Distributed systems expertise required
- **Streaming**: Real-time processing capabilities not in Oxigraph
