# OxiRS v0.1.0-alpha.2 Release Notes

**Release date:** 2025-10-04  
**Tag:** `v0.1.0-alpha.2`

## Overview

The second alpha milestone rounds out the persistence and tooling story for OxiRS. This release brings durable on-disk storage, a production-grade CLI experience, SPARQL federation with remote endpoints, and the instrumentation required for real deployments—all while keeping the existing AI-assisted workflow intact.

> ⚠️ Alpha quality: APIs and configuration formats may still change before the beta. Please evaluate carefully before adopting in mission-critical environments.

## Highlights

### End-to-End Persistence
- Automatic save/load of datasets in N-Quads format
- Streaming import/export/migrate covering Turtle, N-Triples, N-Quads, TriG, RDF/XML, JSON-LD, and N3
- Parallel batch ingestion with configurable worker pools and progress reporting

### Query Experience & Federation
- Full-featured SPARQL REPL with history search, templates, syntax hints, and multi-line editing
- Standards-compliant output formatters (table, JSON, CSV/TSV, XML) for SELECT/ASK/CONSTRUCT/DESCRIBE
- SPARQL 1.1 `SERVICE` support with retries, `SERVICE SILENT`, exponential backoff, and JSON results merging

### Observability & Security
- Prometheus metrics, slow-query tracing, and request correlation IDs across services
- OAuth2/OIDC authentication, JWT verification, seven security headers, and HSTS enabled by default
- Structured logging and telemetry hooks integrated with the SciRS2 runtime

### Performance & Quality
- SIMD-accelerated operators via SciRS2 across critical query paths
- 3,750+ unit and integration tests plus federation scenarios validated against DBpedia and Wikidata
- Criterion benchmarks covering the CLI ingest/export workflows

## Upgrade Notes

1. **CLI**: `cargo install oxirs --version 0.1.0-alpha.2`
2. **Workspace crates**: update `Cargo.toml` dependencies to `"0.1.0-alpha.2"` variants.
3. **Datasets**: existing alpha.1 datasets remain compatible and will be auto-migrated by the new persistence layer on first access.
4. **Federation**: ensure outbound HTTPS is allowed and configure endpoint retries/timeouts in `oxirs-fuseki` when enabling the `SERVICE` clause.

## Known Limitations

- Performance tuning for datasets exceeding 100M triples is still underway
- AI-focused crates (`oxirs-chat`, `oxirs-embed`, `oxirs-shacl-ai`) remain experimental
- Advanced serialization walkthroughs and architecture docs are still being drafted
