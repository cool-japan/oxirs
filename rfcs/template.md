# RFC NNNN: [Title]

- **RFC Number**: NNNN
- **Title**: [Descriptive title]
- **Author(s)**: [Your name and contact]
- **Status**: Draft
- **Created**: [Date]
- **Updated**: [Date]

## Summary

Brief (one-paragraph) explanation of the proposal.

## Motivation

Why are we doing this? What use cases does it support? What is the expected outcome?

## Detailed Design

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody familiar with OxiRS to understand, and for somebody familiar with the implementation to implement.

### API Changes

Detail any changes to public APIs, including:
- New functions/methods
- Modified signatures
- Deprecated functionality
- Breaking changes

### Implementation Strategy

How will this be implemented? What are the key components?

### Examples

Provide code examples showing how the feature would be used.

```rust
// Example code here
```

## Drawbacks

Why should we *not* do this?

## Rationale and Alternatives

- Why is this design the best in the space of possible designs?
- What other designs have been considered and what is the rationale for not choosing them?
- What is the impact of not doing this?

## Prior Art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal:
- Does this feature exist in other similar systems?
- What lessons can be learned from those implementations?

## Unresolved Questions

- What parts of the design do you expect to resolve through the RFC process?
- What related issues do you consider out of scope but might be addressed in the future?

## Future Possibilities

Think about what the natural extension and evolution of your proposal would be and how it would affect OxiRS as a whole. This is a good place to "dump ideas" that are out of scope for the current RFC but are otherwise related.

## Implementation Timeline

If applicable, provide a rough timeline for implementation:
- Phase 1: [Description and timeline]
- Phase 2: [Description and timeline]
- Phase 3: [Description and timeline]
