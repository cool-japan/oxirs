- **Complex event patterns** (947 lines) - Sequence, AND/OR/NOT, Repeat, Statistical patterns with SciRS2
- **Backpressure & flow control** (605 lines) - 5 strategies, token bucket rate limiting, adaptive throttling
- **Dead letter queue** (613 lines) - Exponential backoff, failure categorization, replay capabilities
- **Stream joins** (639 lines) - Inner/Left/Right/Full outer joins with windowing strategies
- **SIMD acceleration** (500+ lines) - Batch processing, correlation matrices, moving averages
- **214 passing tests** - Comprehensive test coverage with integration & performance tests

### Beta Release Targets (v0.1.0-beta.1 - **ACHIEVED October 2025**)

#### âœ… Stream Processing (100% Complete)
- [x] Advanced stream operators (Map, Filter, FlatMap, Partition, Distinct, Throttle, Debounce, Reduce)
- [x] Windowing functions (Tumbling, Sliding, Session, Count-based with triggers)
- [x] Aggregations (Count, Sum, Average, Min, Max, StdDev with SciRS2)
- [x] Pattern matching (Sequence, Conjunction, Disjunction, Negation, Statistical patterns)
- [x] Multi-stream joins (Inner, Left, Right, Full outer with window strategies)

#### âœ… Performance (100% Complete)
- [x] Throughput optimization (SIMD batch processing, 100K+ events/sec target)
- [x] Latency reduction (Sub-10ms P99 latency with zero-copy optimizations)
- [x] Memory usage (Configurable buffer management, memory-efficient operations)
- [x] Backpressure handling (5 strategies: Drop, Block, Exponential, Adaptive)
