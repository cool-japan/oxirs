#### **üìä Technical Implementation Details**
```rust
// Before: Timeout not recorded
Ok(Err(_)) | Err(_) => Ok(false), // Either query failed or timed out

// After: Timeout explicitly recorded
Ok(Err(_)) => Ok(false), // Query failed
Err(_) => {
    // Timeout occurred - record this as an error since the request was attempted
    self.record_error("health_check_timeout").await;
    Ok(false)
}
```

#### **üéØ Current Session Status**
