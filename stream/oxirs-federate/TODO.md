# OxiRS Federate - TODO

*Last Updated: October 12, 2025*

## âœ… Current Status: v0.1.0-alpha.3 - Beta Features Complete!

**oxirs-federate** provides production-ready federated query processing with distributed transactions.

### Alpha.3 Release Status (October 12, 2025)
- **ALL Beta Release Targets Completed** - Ready for beta!
- **285 passing tests** with zero warnings
- **Distributed Transactions** with 2PC and Saga patterns
- **Advanced authentication** (OAuth2, SAML, JWT, API keys, Basic, S2S)
- **Complete monitoring** with OpenTelemetry, circuit breakers, auto-healing
- **SciRS2 integration** throughout for performance and ML optimizations
- **Production-ready** features implemented

## ðŸŽ¯ Beta Release Targets (v0.1.0-beta.1) - âœ… COMPLETED IN ALPHA.3

### Federation Engine âœ…
- âœ… Query optimization (cost models, ML-based predictions)
- âœ… Source selection (pattern coverage, predicate filtering, range selection)
- âœ… Join strategies (bind join, hash join, nested loop, adaptive)
- âœ… Result integration (conflict resolution, partial results, error handling)

### Performance âœ…
- âœ… Parallel execution (adaptive execution, work stealing patterns)
- âœ… Caching strategies (multi-level, TTL policies, bloom filters)
- âœ… Connection pooling (dynamic sizing, health checks, circuit breakers)
- âœ… Query planning (reoptimization, historical performance tracking)

### Features âœ…
- âœ… Authentication support (OAuth2, SAML, JWT, API keys, Basic, Service-to-Service)
- âœ… Service discovery (mDNS, Kubernetes, auto-discovery, capability assessment)
- âœ… Failure handling (circuit breakers, auto-healing, recovery recommendations)
- âœ… Monitoring (OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, distributed tracing, real-time metrics)

### Integration âœ…
- âœ… GraphQL federation (schema stitching, entity resolution, query translation)
- âœ… Streaming support (real-time processing, backpressure handling, NATS/Kafka)
- âœ… Distributed transactions (Two-Phase Commit, Saga patterns, eventual consistency)
- âœ… Load balancing (adaptive algorithms, health-aware routing, performance-based)

### v0.2.0 Targets (Q1 2026)
- [ ] Advanced optimization
- [ ] Multi-level federation
- [ ] Schema alignment
- [ ] Production hardening
