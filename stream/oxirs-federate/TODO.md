- Production-grade LSTM/transformer models
- Distributed training for ML models
- Advanced visualization and dashboarding
- Integration with external ML frameworks
- Real-time model deployment
- A/B testing framework for query optimization

### Note
All advanced features have been implemented in functional form. Some features use simplified algorithms (e.g., basic neural networks instead of full transformers) to maintain reasonable compile times and dependencies while providing the core functionality.
